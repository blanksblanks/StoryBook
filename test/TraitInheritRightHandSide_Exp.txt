Aurora: Hi, my name is Aurora!
Aurora: I am auditioning for the part of Elsa in Frozen.
In case you didn't recognize me, I was in Disney's Sleeping Beauty.

Anna: Hi, my name is Anna!
Anna: I'm auditioning for the part of Anna in Frozen.
I don't have any experience, but I think I have great potential! Plus, all of these old princesses only know how to play roles that depend on men. I can be a strong, independent, and fearless princess!!
Producers: You're hired! And we'll pay you 2000 dollars!
